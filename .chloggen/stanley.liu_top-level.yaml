note: The Datadog exporter now has a config option to identify top-level spans by span kind. This new logic can be enabled by setting `traces.compute_top_level_by_span_kind` to true in the Datadog exporter config.

# Mandatory: One or more tracking issues related to the change. You can use the PR number here if no issue exists.

# These lines will be padded with 2 spaces and then inserted directly into the document.

  With this new logic, root spans and spans with a server or consumer `span.kind` will be marked as top-level. Additionally, spans with a client or producer `span.kind` will have stats computed.
  Enabling this feature flag may increase the number of spans that generate trace metrics, and may change which spans appear as top-level in Datadog.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
